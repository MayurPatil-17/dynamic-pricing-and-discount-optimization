# 🛒 Dynamic Pricing & Discount Optimization

## 📘 Project Overview  
This project implements an end-to-end **Dynamic Pricing & Discount Optimization** system for a retail business.  
It uses **Python, MySQL, and Power BI** to determine optimal discount rates, uncover hidden pricing patterns, and maximize profit while maintaining customer retention.  

Due to inconsistent patterns and weak accuracy from supervised learning models, **unsupervised clustering** was chosen to segment products/customers by their pricing and profit behavior.

## 🎯 Business Objective  
Retailers often offer discounts without analyzing their impact on profitability.  
This project aims to:

- 🔹 Identify the ideal discount range for maximizing profit  
- 🔹 Understand country-wise and category-wise performance  
- 🔹 Detect high-margin vs low-margin products  
- 🔹 Provide a visual, data-driven pricing dashboard to support decision-making

## 🧠 Key Insights  

✅ Discounts between **5–15%** consistently deliver optimal profits  
✅ High-value customers remain loyal even with smaller discounts  
✅ Discounts beyond **20%** sharply reduce overall margins  
✅ Clustering helped uncover **four distinct product segments** based on sales, discounts, and profits  
✅ The **UK and Western Europe** drive the majority of total revenue
